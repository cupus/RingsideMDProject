        <h5>Our Use of Cookies.</h5>
		<p>Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a small piece of data or a text file that is downloaded
			to your computer or mobile device when you access certain websites. Cookies may contain text
			that can be read by the web server that delivered the cookie to you. The text contained in the

			Most web browsers can be set to disable the use of cookies. However, if you disable these cookies,
			you may not be able to access features on our website correctly or at all.
		</p>
		<p><span class="rs-font-weight-semibold">Performance Cookies.</span>
			These cookies collect information about the use of the website, such as pages visited,
			traffic sources, users’ interests, content management, and other website measurements.

		<p><span class="rs-font-weight-semibold">Functional Cookies.</span>
			These cookies enable the website to remember a user’s choices – such as their language, user name,
			and other personal choices – while using the website. They can also be used to deliver services,
			such as letting a user make a blog post, listen to audio, or watch videos on the website.
		</p>
		<p><span class="rs-font-weight-semibold">Media Cookies.</span>
			These cookies can be used to improve a website’s performance and provide special features and content.

		</p>
		<p><span class="rs-font-weight-semibold">Session Cookies.</span>
			These cookies allow websites to link the actions of a user during a browser session.
			They may be used for a variety of purposes, such as remembering what a user has put in their
			shopping cart as they browse a website. Session cookies also permit users to be recognized as
			they navigate a website so that any item or page changes they make are remembered from page to page.
			Session cookies expire after a browser session; thus, they are not stored long term.
		</p>
		<p><span class="rs-font-weight-semibold">Persistent Cookies.</span>
			These cookies are stored on a user’s device in between browser sessions, which allows the user’s
			preferences or actions across a site (or, in some cases, across different sites) to be remembered.

            it travels over the Internet using industry-standard technology for conducting secure online transactions.
            Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee against the loss or misuse of your PII or secure data transmission over
            the Internet because of its nature. We strongly urge you to protect any password you may have for our<span id="InternationalDataTransfers"></span>

            this privacy policy, we will post those changes on our website so that our users and customers
            are always aware of what information we collect, use, and disclose. If at any time we decide

            we will provide advance notice by email (sent to the email address on file in your account).

            policy in effect when the information was collected. In all cases, your continued use of our website,<span id="QuestionsAboutOurPrivacyPolicy"></span>
            services, and products after any change to this privacy policy will constitute your acceptance
